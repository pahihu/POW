POW self-extracting package
===========================

This package contains the following items:

- pow32_30b version
- patches from the POW32 group's Files/Patches folder

The included patches are:

- BoostEd.Source.zip
- Boosted32.zip
- Opal.zip
- RTS.zip
- obrn32.zip
- pow.zip
- SymBrowser32.zip

    To see the the actual contents of the package, please visit the
ChangeLog section at the end of this file.

    I have recompiled the C sources with Visual C++ 6.0 and then
recompiled the whole package with itself. I have made some modifications
in the batch files for some packages to produce lib files in VC5 format,
since the linker included with POW understands this format only.

    To install the redistributable DLLs please run the PostInstall.bat
file, after you extract the package contents in a directory.
